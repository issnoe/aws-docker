## What will students learn in your course?
- You will slowly start by learning Docker Fundamentals and move on to ECS or Fargate. 
- You will learn Docker fundamentals by implementing usecases like download image from Docker Hub and run on local desktop and build an image locally, test and push to Docker Hub.
- You will master the Elastic Container Service core concepts like Task Definition, Task and Service.
- You will learn using ECR - Elastic Container Registry in combination with ECS. 
- You will learn Docker Image Build, Push to ECR, run it as Task on ECS or Fargate Clusters.
- You will learn usage of Application Load Balancers in combination with ECS Tasks (Containers) and also implement URI based routing on ALB.
- You will understand and implement Service Autoscaling concepts of ECS
- You will implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery concepts using AWS Developer Tools like CodeBuild, CodeCommit and CodePipeline.
- You will learn to master microservices deployments on ECS in combination with AWS CloudMap (for Service Discovery) and with AWS App Mesh (Service Mesh).
- You will learn to deploy Microservices Canary Deployments using AWS App Mesh.
- You will write CloudFormation Templates for Fargate Deployments starting from Network stack (VPC) to Service Stack (ECS or Fargate). 
- You will learn to implement Distributed Tracing using X-Ray without making any application level code changes when AWS App Mesh (Envoy Proxy) is in place with ECS Deployments.

## Are there any course requirements or prerequisites?
- You must have an AWS account to follow with me for hands-on activities.
- You dont need to have any basic Docker knowledge also to start this course.  As part of Docker Fundamentals we have covered that too. 

## Who are your target students?
- AWS Architects or Sysadmins or Developers who are planning to master Elastic Container Service (ECS) for Docker deployments.
- Any beginner who is interested in learning Docker fundamentals and moving on to master Docker Container deployments on AWS Cloud. 
- Technologists who want to implement Continuous Integration and Continuos Delivery/Deployment process (CI/CD) in AWS with Docker Container Images.
